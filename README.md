*An Embedded Software Engineer with a passion for sustainability! I graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering in 2019, and I've spent the last three and a half years with Rad Power Bikes! In the fast-paced startup environment I had my hands on every part of the electrical system, especially the motor controller and its firmware. I'm currently looking for my next adventure, so feel free to reach out!*

*Unfortunately, I've never been very active here on my personal Github account, so I've been working to change that for the past few weeks! Check out my [ESP32 BLDC](https://github.com/rstreets96/ESP32_BLDC) project that I'm working on to see some of what I've learned over the past few years!*

 ## âœ¨About Meâœ¨
ðŸ›  Iâ€™m currently working on a motor controller based on the ESP32.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use the networking APIs of the ESP32 to implement OTA updates.

ðŸŒ± I'm also spending some time learning frontend languages like HTML/CSS/JS. Check out my [Github Pages](https://rstreets96.github.io/) site to see the progress!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my biggest Python project!
